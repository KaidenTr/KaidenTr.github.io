							<h2>The Beginning </h2>
							<p>In 2017, I began my journey to start building my first personal computer. My parents got me various game consoles at a young age such as the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. When I was just looking around the internet, people alway brought up how you can build your own computer to give even better performance and the flexibility to do anything. I was head deep on the internet searching on what I need and how I can build one. I would watch hours and hours of different Youtube videos. I studied every step putting parts together. After watching countless videos, I realized my budget was very limited. As a young teenager, I had little income. The only way I get money is from my parents. Since they already got me a console, I wouldn’t ask them for more money for me to build a computer. What I did instead was to save my money that I got from my parent choirs and buy different parts within my budget.</p>

							<h2>The First One</h2>
							<p>In my research finding parts, I found a cheap refurbished Dell Optiplex 7010 Mid Tower on Ebay. I decided to get this one because it has most parts that I need. The CPU is an Intel i5-3470 which did its job all right, but it can bottleneck other parts in some ways. It came with 8GB of RAM for memory. The motherboard has additional slots of memory which I can expand later. It contains 1TB of hard drive with a preinstalled Windows 10. However I added a separate 256 GB Solid State Drive and installed the Operation System for faster bootup and browsing experience. One thing I replaced from the pre-built PC was the power supply. Since I was aiming for a gaming PC, I did not cheap out on Graphic Card. The GPU I got was an Nvidia GTX 1050. I knew that when I add a GPU to my computer I would also need to replace the stocked power supply that came with the pre-built PC. So I got myself a 500W EVGA power supply. Looking past, I should go to something with a lower wattage. After I assembled parts together, I was happy with how my computer performed. Overall, the build cost me below $500. During the process, what I learned is that you can build a solid PC without spending a lot of money. With research and knowing what you need for your computer, you can make your own computer with various different parts.</p>

							<h2>Second Time Around</h2>
							<p>After a couple years, I wanted to upgrade my computer. By this time, I got myself a job and a good amount of savings, which I have more options of what I can get. In late 2020, Nvidia announced their new upcoming Graphic Cards, RTX 30 series. I set my goal to get the mid to high end level, RTX 3070. Unlike the first computer I built, in this second PC, I want to start fresh. First of all, I looked for a CPU that can keep up with the power of the GPU, so I picked the I5-10400. When looking for a motherboard, I can’t reuse my old one from my first computer because the socket isn't compatible with the new chip and only supports DDR3. I bought a new motherboard with ASUS H410M A Pro. Since my components are going to be more powerful than the last one computers, I also need to get a new power supply, so I got a Corsair 550W power unit. Of course, I also installed 16GB of  DDR4 RAM. The only thing I migrated from my last computer was the storage drives. One of my biggest challenges this time around was acquiring the graphic card. The product is rarely available and many scalpers would instantly get it right as they are available. I used a third party seller Facebook Marketplace to give one of the graphic cards. Unfortunately, I had to pay $250 over the MSRP, it would be a given purchase in the end. Another challenge I faced was cable management. The way I solved this is to zipties groups of cable. I tied knots for a long cable to avoid fans from touching it. Also use the space in the case to organize cable to go specific ways. Overall, The transition to the new PC was a huge leap and I’m glad it was a successful project. </p>

							<p>With experiences with building my own computers, my close peers tend to ask me for help about this kind stuff. When I help them with the process of building a computer, I like to be jealous because they have someone to help them. But on the side, my takeaway is that my experience of self taught led to me having more experience with building a computer than I would otherwise.</p>
